# Graph Searcher (A-star & Lowest Cost First)

This program was completed as part of the assessment process for the Artifical Intelligence course taken during my third year at university. The idea was to transform a real life optimisation problem and implement different search algorithms to complete the mazes. The two search algorithms used were A-Star and Lowest Cost First Search (LCFS). Euclidean distance was used as the heuristic value for A-Star search as it gave a realistic underestimation of the cost from node to destination.
